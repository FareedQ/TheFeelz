<p>This is an Emotional Intelligence trainer that I, Fareed Quraishi, developed at BitMaker in 2015. It was developed to demonstrate my skills as a coder at that time. It was not maintained after the demonstration the final demonstration and was never intended to be taken to the app store. <em>but did inspire future apps</em></p>

<p>By the end of my term at BitMaker, the students were asked to make a app that would demonstrate their skills to potential hiring partners. For my passion project I created an emotional intelligence trainer, I eloquently named “The Feelz”.  It was a slang play on words for feelings that is described here by urban dictionary. I was a fun assignment and I did accomplish a lot by playing around in different areas of code. Quickly this project became more of a demonstration of my skills at the time instead of being an app I’d ever bring to market because I just kept trying to fit in more functionality to say, “look at what I can do”. This app is still in my portfolio because it is one of the best demonstration of my skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Feelz is a Emotional Intelligence (EI) trainer, themed with characters from Disney’s Inside Out.  It is design to target emotionally contentious individuals of all ages. Built as an iPhone app using Swift 2.0, it assists people in assessing emotional state, improving their vocabulary, and ultimately bring ease of mind using mantras and meditation practice. This app is built on Advanced Programmatic Selection Animations, API Request from DictionaryAPI.com, XML Parsing, iOS Map Kit, Core Location, Collection Views, AV Foundation, and Local Notification. The data collected on the app’s activity is recorded using JSON.</p>
